First implementation of a simple Remote-CAPI server.
It works with the CAPI-2.0 interface offered by CAPI4Linux.
Tested so far with Brickware from Bintec for a MS-Windows Client.


Installation:

- add the following line to /etc/services:

  capi 6000/tcp


- add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf:

  capi stream tcp nowait.9999 /sbin/rcapid rcapid


- restart inetd

Usage:
rcapid [-c <forced controller number>] [-l <loglevel>]
       
To switch on logging into file /tmp/rcapid.log, a
loglevel greater than 0 must be given.

If rcapid shall only export one specific controller (in case
you have more than one), you can specify to -c the local
controller number which will be available as controller 1
for clients via the net. With this option you can setup
more than one rcapid's with different inetd ports for
specific controllers.


Have fun,
