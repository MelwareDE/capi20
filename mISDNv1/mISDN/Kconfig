config MISDN_DRV
	tristate "Support modular ISDN driver"
	help
	  Enable support for the modular ISDN driver.
	  This driver is the successor of the famous HiSax driver.

if MISDN_DRV!=n

config MISDN_MEMDEBUG
	bool "Enable memory leak debug for mISDN"
	help
	  This option is for watching the use of several resources in mISDN.
	  It includes extra code to maintain list of allocated memory and
	  sk_buffs. On module unload you can see not freed resources an
	  their allocation orging and some object specific informations.
	  If unsure, say 'N'.

config MISDN_DEBUGTOOL
	tristate "mISDN Debugtool"
	help
	  Include mISDN_debugtool module.

config MISDN_AVM_FRITZ
	bool "Support for AVM Fritz!Cards"
	depends on PCI || ISA
	help
	  Enable support for AVM Fritz!Card PCI and PnP.

config MISDN_NETJET
	bool "Support for NETJet cards"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Enable support for Traverse Technologies' NETJet PCI cards.

config MISDN_HFCPCI
	bool "Support for HFC PCI cards"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Enable support for card with Cologne Chips Design HFC PCI based
	  cards.

config MISDN_HFCMULTI
	bool "Support for HFC multiport cards (HFC-4S/8S/E1)"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Enable support for card with Cologne Chip AG's HFC multiport
	  chip. There are three types of chips that are quite similar,
	  but the interface is different:
	   * HFC-4S (4 S/T interfaces on one chip)
	   * HFC-8S (8 S/T interfaces on one chip)
	   * HFC-E1 (E1 interface for 2Mbit ISDN)

if MISDN_HFCMULTI!=n

config HFCMULTI_PCIMEM
	bool "HFC multiport driver with memory mapped IO"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Use memory mapped PCI access rather than IO access.
	  This feature MIGHT be slightly faster, especially when
	  using hardware DTMF detection. Also it may cause trouble with some
	  PCI bridges.
	  If unsure, say 'N'.

config MISDN_HFCUSB
	bool "Support for HFC-S USB based TAs"
	depends on USB && EXPERIMENTAL
	help

config MISDN_W6692
	bool "Support for Winbond 6692 based cards"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Enable support for Winbond 6692 PCI chip based cards.

config MISDN_DSP
	bool "Digital Audio Processing of transparent data"
	help
	  Enable support for digital audio processing capability.
	  This module may be used for special applications that require
	  cross connecting of bchannels, conferencing, dtmf decoding
	  echo cancelation, tone generation, and Blowfish encryption and
	  decryption.
	  It may use hardware features if available.
	  E.g. it is required for PBX4Linux. Go to http://isdn.eversberg.eu
	  and get more informations about this module and it's usage.
	  If unsure, say 'N'.

config MISDN_L1OIP
	bool "ISDN over IP tunnel"
	help
	  Enable support for ISDN over IP tunnel.

	  It features:
	    - layer 1 control via network keepalive frames
	    - dynamic IP exchange, if one or both peers have dynamic IPs
	    - channel bundeling for reduced IP overhead
	    - BRI (S0) and PRI (S2M) interface

	  NOTE: This protocol is called 'Layer 1 over IP' and is not
	  compatible with ISDNoIP (Agfeo) or TDMoIP.
